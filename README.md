**This package is deprecated. All features were transfered to www.x64dbg.com. So please have a look at this project.**

Based on the [BeaEngine Disassembler][1] we create a GUI that allows you to work with ease on disassemblies. Some special highlights that most other open source disassemblers do **not** have:

 - auto comments for common api-functions
 - jump view displays jump target addresses
 - content sensitive context menu
 - Syntaxhighlighting (Tokenizer)

It use the following 3rd party projects:

 - [Qt 5][2]
 - [Fugue Icons][3]
